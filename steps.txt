COLOR GENERATOR
A simple tool for finding colors.

To Do:
- keyboard tips?

Potential Features
- Text input of color values? (click on color value and change it...)

Fixes Needed:
- Add the input back to mode selection? Not sure this is great for accessibility (or change these all to buttons)
- The way I'm updating select/unselect is sort of a hack..

Challenges Along the Way:
- keyCode is being deprecated. find alternatives.
- conversion algorithm not totally accurate
- used flexbox to center div. set max height of display div to random number. not sure if this is the best way of implementing this.
- radio buttons. hard to get the selection javascript right.

Learned:
- controlling the DOM via javascript
- building out different types of elements
- arrays
- handling basic libraries

Issues
- slider styling
- center display div
- another text color if neither white nor black is > 4.5
- conversion numbers are wrong
- centering of div



tips:
- show initial space bar tip
- if user hits the spacebar, fade that tip out and fade the keyboard controls tip in
  if (spacebardUsed = true)
  if (keyboardUsed)
