COLOR GENERATOR
A simple tool for finding colors.

To Do:
- keyboard tips?

Potential Features
- Text input of color values? (click on color value and change it...)

Fixes Needed:
- Add the input back to mode selection? Not sure this is great for accessibility (or change these all to buttons)
- The way I'm updating select/unselect is sort of a hack..

Challenges Along the Way:
- keyCode is being deprecated. find alternatives.
- conversion algorithm not totally accurate
- used flexbox to center div. set max height of display div to random number. not sure if this is the best way of implementing this.
- radio buttons. hard to get the selection javascript right.

Learned:
- controlling the DOM via javascript
- building out different types of elements
- arrays
- handling basic libraries

Issues
- slider styling
- center display div
- another text color if neither white nor black is > 4.5


tips:
- show initial space bar tip
- if user hits the spacebar, fade that tip out and fade the keyboard controls tip in
  if (spacebardUsed = true)
  if (keyboardUsed)


To Do:
- Clean up JS
- Responsive
- Change sliders to HSL when that is selected?
- Check scoping of variables
- Hover style of buttons should match selected state
- fix interfering tool tips
- think about replacing css for a swatch download feature
- Using max height for display but can't flexbox deal with that?

Process:
1. Generate random color values
2. Update RGB variables
3. Convert RGB colors to HEX and HSL
4. Update Hex and HSL variables

5. Update page background color
6. Update RGB, HEX, and HSL displays
7. Update slider values

8. calculate contrast ratio and update font color

9. update color array
