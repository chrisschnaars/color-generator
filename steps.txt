JS COLOR PICKER  - v2
A simple tool for exploring RGB color values.
Now trying to make this without any p5js libraries - just pure javascript.


to-do
- array so you can go back (and forth);
- keyboard tips?

potential add-ons:
- use key press + dpad (i.e. hold down r and increment up and down);
- text input??? (click on color value and change it...)
- go back one color?
- keyboard shortcuts for everything
- add the input back to mode selection? not sure this is great for accessibility (or change these all to buttons)
- the way I'm updating select/unselect is sort of a hack

challenges:
- keyCode is being deprecated. find alternatives.
- conversion Algorithm not totally accurate
- used flexbox to center div. set max height of display div to random number. not sure if this is the best way of implemening this.
- radio buttons. hard to get the selection javascript right.

learning:
- controlling the DOM via javascript
- building out different types of elements

issues:
- slider styling
- center display div
- another text color if neither white nor black is > 4.5
- conversion numbers are wrong
- cenetring of div


idea
- add each color to an array
- use arrow keys to go back and forth
- would it be better if we showed all formats, in text-entry boxes, and allowed you to change values?
- make copying easier?
