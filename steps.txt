JS COLOR PICKER  - v2
A simple tool for exploring RGB color values.
Now trying to make this without any p5js libraries - just pure javascript.


to-do
- keyboard tips?

potential add-ons:
- use key press + dpad (i.e. hold down r and increment up and down);
- text input??? (click on color value and change it...)
- keyboard shortcuts for everything
- add the input back to mode selection? not sure this is great for accessibility (or change these all to buttons)
- the way I'm updating select/unselect is sort of a hack

challenges:
- keyCode is being deprecated. find alternatives.
- conversion Algorithm not totally accurate
- used flexbox to center div. set max height of display div to random number. not sure if this is the best way of implemening this.
- radio buttons. hard to get the selection javascript right.

learning:
- controlling the DOM via javascript
- building out different types of elements
- arrays

issues:
- slider styling
- center display div
- another text color if neither white nor black is > 4.5
- conversion numbers are wrong
- cenetring of div


idea
- add each color to an array
- use arrow keys to go back and forth
- would it be better if we showed all formats, in text-entry boxes, and allowed you to change values?
- make copying easier?



color array:
- create an array variable
- each time a color is generated, add that to the end of the array
- if the array gets too big (20?), remove the first item
- user can hit the back/next controls to move through the array
- if the user moves back in the array, and generates a new color, remove all items beyond that


move through array
if user presses left Arrow
- check that array is not at pos 0;
